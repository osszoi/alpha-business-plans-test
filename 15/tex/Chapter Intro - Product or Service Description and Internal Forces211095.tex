 

Venezuelan Hot Dogs is a business founded by Lucas that sells gourmet hot dogs. Its target market is the people living in the Doral and its competitive advantage lies in quality and service.

It currently employs 5 people, with a history of having started from a small point selling hotdogs in New York City. 

Venezuelan Hot Dogs operates as a Limited Liability Company and offers two types of hot dogs: “Hot Dog 1” and “Hot Dog 2” which meet customer needs through taste, fast delivery timescales and convenience factors such as local adaptation for Venezuelan communities living nearby . This sets it apart from competitors who may not offer this level customization when it comes to catering for different cultural tastes. The main competitors are all food restaurants located within the Sawgrass Mall, with an estimated market size of 30 billion dollars. There is high demand for their products or services due to convenience factors such as taste and speed; however there is also high competition, low prices, supply chain issues, price competition, product differentiation through marketing strategies employed by larger chains such as McDonalds or Wendies etc., bargaining power of suppliers being high due to limited resources available and bargaining power of buyers being non-existent due to lack thereof.. Additionally there is also threat from new entrants entering the market every day as well as substitute healthy options becoming increasingly popular among consumers.  

In terms if internal strengths , unique recipes , strong brand presence , skilled workforce can be highlighted whereas weaknesses include limited resources , weak brand presence , lack off differentiation when compared against larger chains . External opportunities include new markets , partnerships & technological advancements whereas external threats encompass competition , regulatory changes & economic downturns . Strategies implemented should capitalize on strengths & opportunities while addressing weaknesses & threats ; these could involve marketing & communication campaigns tailored towards Venezuelan communities alongside pricing strategies aimed at positioning themselves above fast food sector norms . With these strategies in place Venezuelan Hot Dogs will be able to reach its short-term goals of selling 4 million units annually with 5 branches across Doral while setting up the foundation for long term success by expanding into other areas beyond Doral.
