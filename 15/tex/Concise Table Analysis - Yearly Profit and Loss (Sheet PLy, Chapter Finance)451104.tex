The company appears to be in good financial health, as evidenced by increasing revenues, profits and cash flow over the five months. Cost of goods sold is decreasing relative to revenue, resulting in higher gross profit margins. Operating expenses are being managed well, with EBITDA and EBIT margins improving steadily. Net income margin is also increasing each month. Overall, there are no immediate areas of concern that need to be addressed; however, the company should continue monitoring expenses and cash flow for signs of trouble.
