Venezuelan Hot Dogs is a limited liability company that has been operating for four years. It offers two types of hot dogs with unique recipes that meet customer needs through taste, speed and convenience. The company has identified its target market as the people living in Doral who are looking for new innovative tastes. To capitalize on their advantages, Venezuelan Hot Dogs plan on implementing various strategies such as launching marketing campaigns targeted towards their target market (the Venezuelan community) via social media platforms, digital campaigns word-of-mouth promotion or fliers at malls. Their pricing strategy consists in setting higher prices than other fast food restaurants but still keeping it affordable enough so customers can enjoy their product without breaking their budget. Distribution will be done mainly at the point of sale located in Sawgrass Mall where customer service will also be provided if needed and employee training plans have been designed following standards set by management team ensuring employees are up-to date with company policies procedures etc.. These strategies aim to reach the short-term goal of selling 4 million hot dogs while achieving the long-term goal of having five branches.
