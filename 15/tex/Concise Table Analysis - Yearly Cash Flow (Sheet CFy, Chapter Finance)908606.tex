The company's financial health is strong, with a steady increase in net income and operating cash flow over the five-year period. Expenses, such as D&A and WC, remain relatively constant while CAPEX remains low. Cash flow from bank payments/loans is negligible, but cash balance is bolstered by CF from investment. Overall, the company appears to be in good financial health; however, it may be beneficial for them to look into increasing their CAPEX spending to further improve profits and cash flow.
