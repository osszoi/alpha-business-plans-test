\nonumsidenote{This section outlines Venezuelan Hot Dogs' marketing and sales strategies, which include identifying the target market, reaching out to customers, pricing strategy, product/service differentiation, distribution channels and employee training. The company will also use internal strengths such as a unique recipe and external opportunities such as the large Venezuelan community in the area to capitalize on its advantages.} 
Venezuelan Hot Dogs is a limited liability company that has been operating for four years. It offers two types of hot dogs with unique recipes that meet customer needs through taste, speed and convenience. The target market is the people living in Doral who are looking for new innovative tastes. The competitive advantage lies in quality services as well as an attractive packaging and convenience. Venezuelan Hot Dogs' short-term goal is to sell 4 million hot dogs while their long-term goal is to have five branches. 

In order to reach this goal, Venezuelan Hot Dogs must identify their main competitors which include all food restaurants in Sawgrass Mall as well as big chains like McDonald's or Wendy's. Furthermore they need to analyze trends within the industry by acknowledging that people are increasingly looking for healthy food options instead of fast food products. Additionally they need to assess bargaining power of suppliers which is quite high due to there being only one bread supplier available. Lastly they must recognize that there is no bargaining power from buyers due to their low prices strategy for customers. 

The products offered by Venezuelan Hot Dogs set them apart from competitors by offering a unique recipe with local adaptation for the Venezuelan community along with great packaging and convenience served faster than other fast food restaurants . In terms of internal strengths, these include a strong brand name and skilled workforce whereas weaknesses consist of limited resources and lack of capital investment . External opportunities exist through new markets partnerships or technological advancements while threats come from competition regulatory changes or economic downturns . 

To capitalize on these strengths and opportunities whilst addressing weaknesses and threats ,Venezuelan Hot Dogs plan on implementing various strategies such as launching marketing campaigns targeted towards their target market (the Venezuelan community) via social media platforms , digital campaigns word-of-mouth promotion or fliers at malls . Their pricing strategy consists in setting higher prices than other fast food restaurants but still keeping it affordable enough so customers can enjoy their product without breaking their budget . Distribution will be done mainly at the point of sale located in Sawgrass Mall where customer service will also be provided if needed . Lastly employee training plans have been designed following standards set by management team ensuring employees are up-to date with company policies procedures etc..
