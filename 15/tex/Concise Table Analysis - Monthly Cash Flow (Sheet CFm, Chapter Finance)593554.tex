The company's revenue is consistent throughout the year, with net income of US$734 million and total operating cash flow of US$1.6 billion. Expenses are relatively low, with only US$246 million in working capital costs and no capital expenditure. The company has an overall positive cash flow due to a one-time investment of US$150 million at the beginning of the year, as well as a lack of loan payments or other outflows. This indicates that the company is in good financial health, however it should consider further investments or strategies to increase profits over time.
