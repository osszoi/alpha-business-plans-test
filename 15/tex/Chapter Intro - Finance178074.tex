This chapter provides an overview of the financial health of Venezuelan Hot Dogs, including a look at their income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement. The income statement allows us to track revenue and expenses over a given period of time. Revenue sources include sales at their location in Sawgrass Mall, food trucks, catering services, online orders and delivery services. Expenses include costs associated with raw materials such as sausages and buns; labor costs; rent; utilities; marketing expenses; administrative costs; taxes; insurance premiums; depreciation charges for equipment purchases; loan payments (if applicable); research and development expenses (if applicable); professional fees (e.g., accounting or legal fees); equipment leases or rental payments (if applicable). 

The balance sheet provides an overview of a company’s assets, liabilities, and equity at any given point in time. Assets are items owned by the company that have economic value such as cash on hand or accounts receivable due from customers who purchased goods on credit terms. Liabilities are obligations owed by the company such as loans payable to creditors or accounts payable due to suppliers for goods purchased on credit terms. Equity represents ownership interest held by shareholders or owners of the business which includes retained earnings accumulated since inception minus dividends paid out since inception.  

The cash flow statement tracks changes in cash position over a given period of time by tracking net cash inflows from operating activities (sales revenues less operating expenses), net cash inflows from investing activities (purchase/sale of capital assets), net cash flows from financing activities (loans taken/repaid). It also allows us to monitor whether there is sufficient liquidity available to meet our short-term needs such as payroll obligations or purchase inventory when needed without having to borrow funds externally. 

Further evidence that Venezuelan Hot Dogs is doing well financially can be seen through their monthly balance sheet which shows total assets increasing from 155,589 to 163,668 during this 12 month period along with current assets growing significantly over this same timeframe while fixed assets decreased slightly but still remain higher than when it began indicating continued success for Alpha Project's operations. Liabilities and equity have also increased steadily throughout this period further supporting evidence that Venezuelan Hot Dogs is doing well financially while they continue towards becoming an even bigger success in future months/years ahead!
