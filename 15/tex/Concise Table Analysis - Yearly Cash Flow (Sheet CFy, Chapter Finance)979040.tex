The company has shown consistent growth in revenue and profits over the five-year period. However, the negative working capital indicates inefficiencies in managing short-term assets and liabilities. The company has not invested in fixed assets or taken any bank loans during this period, resulting in a positive cash flow from investment and a healthy cash balance. The company should focus on improving its working capital management to optimize its operations and reduce financial risk. It may also consider investing in fixed assets to support future growth opportunities.
