\nonumsidenote{Summary: This section provides an analysis of the assumptions made for the Alpha Project business plan, including growth, inflation, packing and shipping costs, material costs, maintenance costs, other negative recoveries, sales and marketing costs, taxes incurred and results summary.}
The Alpha Project business plan is based on a number of assumptions. Growth was assumed to be at 80\%, inflation was assumed to be 3\%, packing and shipping costs were taken as 1.00\%, material cost was taken as 1.00\% , maintenance cost as 0.50\%, other negative recoveries as 0.25\%, sales and marketing expenses were taken as 3.00\% and taxes incurred were estimated at 20%. 

Based on these assumptions it can be seen that total revenue over 5 years (mm US$) is 13 834 026 while maximum revenue in 5 years (mm US$) is 6 500 492. Total NIAT over 5 years (mm US$) is 2 069 283 with maximum NIAT in 5 years (mm US$) being 1 129 810. The minimum investment required for this project is 148 353 US$. The NPV@10% for the project stands at $2 543 467.76 while IRR stands at 186 \%. 

These figures indicate that the Alpha Project has potential to generate significant returns on investment over a five-year timeframe provided that all of the assumptions hold true throughout this period of time. It should also be noted that there may be some variations in actual performance due to unforeseen circumstances such as changes in market conditions or economic fluctuations which could influence the final outcome of this project significantly.
