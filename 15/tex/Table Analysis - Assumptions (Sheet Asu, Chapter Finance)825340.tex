The Alpha Project has set out its assumptions for financial projections which will form the basis for its business plan. Growth is expected at 80%, which reflects the company's confidence that it can achieve significant market share gains in its target markets within five years from launch date. Inflation has been factored into these plans at 3%; this figure was chosen as it reflects current market conditions in most countries around the world where Alpha Project operates or intends to operate during this period of time. 

Packing and shipping costs have been estimated at 1% due to economies of scale that can be achieved through bulk purchasing power agreements with suppliers as well as efficient logistics management techniques employed by Alpha Project's operations team across all distribution channels worldwide; similarly material costs have also been budgeted at 1%. Maintenance costs have been allocated 0.50% which should cover any foreseeable repairs or replacements necessary throughout this period; other miscellaneous costs such as negative recoveries have been allocated 0.25%. Sales & Marketing expenses have been set at 3%; this figure takes into account both traditional advertising campaigns (television/radio/print) along with digital marketing efforts such as search engine optimization (SEO), pay-per-click (PPC) campaigns etc., all designed to increase brand awareness amongst potential customers globally whilst driving sales conversions through targeted promotions/discounts etc.. Finally taxes are assumed to be 20%; this number was decided upon after taking into consideration any applicable tax credits available depending on country specific regulations relevant to Alpha Projects' activities during this period . 

The results summary section outlines key figures generated from these assumptions; total revenue over five years is estimated at 13 834 026 million US Dollars with a maximum revenue in five year's time being 6 500 492 million US Dollars; Total NIAT over five year's time is projected at 2 069 283 million US Dollars with a maximum NIAT in five year's time being 1 129 810million US Dollars; Minimum Investment required for this project stands at 148 353million USD whilst NPV@10 % stands $2 543 467 76and finally IRR stands at 186%.
