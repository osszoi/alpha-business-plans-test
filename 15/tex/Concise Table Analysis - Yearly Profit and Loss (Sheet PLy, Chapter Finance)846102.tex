The company has shown consistent revenue growth over the past five months, with revenues reaching $6.5 million in month 5. However, expenses have also increased significantly, particularly labor costs and sales and marketing expenses. Despite this, the company has maintained a healthy gross profit margin of around 60% and has generated positive net income each month. The EBITDA margin has also improved significantly from 3.16% in month 1 to 21.85% in month 5, indicating better operational efficiency. The company should focus on controlling its operating expenses to improve profitability further while continuing to grow revenues.
