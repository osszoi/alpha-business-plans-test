\nonumsidenote{This section provides an analysis of the yearly cash flow for Alpha Project. The data shows that net income has increased over the years, with a significant increase in year 3. D&A and WC have remained relatively stable throughout the period, resulting in an overall increase in operating cash flow from year 1 to year 5. CAPEX has been financed through bank payments and investments, with no loans taken out during this period. As a result, net cash has decreased from year 1 to year 5, while cash balance has increased significantly due to investments made during the period.}

The table data provided above shows that Alpha Project's net income (+) increased from $8,814 in Year 1 to $1,129,810 in Year 5. This is an impressive growth rate of 1183\% over five years. During this time span, D&A (+) and WC (-) have remained relatively stable at $8000 and -$39155 respectively; however it should be noted that there was a slight decrease in WC (-) from Year 2 to Year 3. 

Operating Cash Flow (OCF) is calculated by subtracting WC (-) from Net Income (+). OCF increased steadily over the five-year period as Net Income (+) grew and WC (-) decreased slightly between Years 2 and 3. CAPEX - fbank (-), which represents capital expenditures funded by bank payments or loans was zero for all five years indicating that Alpha Project did not take out any loans during this time frame; however CAPEX - fshare (-), which represents capital expenditures funded by shareholder investments totaled $150K for Years 1 \& 2 before dropping off completely for Years 3-5 indicating that Alpha Project had sufficient funds available internally to finance its operations without relying on external sources of financing such as debt or equity issuance. 

CF from Bank Payment / Loan (=), which represents cash flows generated through loan repayment or bank payment was also zero for all five years indicating no loan repayments were made during this time frame either; thus confirming our earlier assessment that Alpha Project did not take out any loans during this period. Consequently CF from Investment (+), which represents cash flows generated through investment activity totaled $150K for Year 1 before dropping off drastically to just $25K for Year 2 before disappearing completely thereafter indicating a decrease in investor confidence after the first two years of operations perhaps due to slowing sales growth or increasing operational costs associated with expansion activities etc.. Despite these decreases however Net Cash still decreased steadily over the five-year period due mainly to increasing Operating Cash Flows (OCFs). 

Finally we see that despite decreasing Net Cash levels overall Cash Balance has grown significantly throughout this time frame primarily due to CFs generated through investment activity totaling $150K each for Years 1 \& 2 followed by another injection of funds totaling $25K into Year 2 prior its
