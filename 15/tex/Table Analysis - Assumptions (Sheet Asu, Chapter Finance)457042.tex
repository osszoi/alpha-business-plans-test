The Alpha Project has made assumptions regarding growth, inflation, packing and shipping, material cost, maintenance cost, other negative recoveries, sales and marketing costs and taxes. The growth rate is assumed to be 80\%, while the inflation rate is 3\%. Packing and Shipping costs are estimated to be 1.00\%, Material Cost at 1.00\% and Maintenance Cost at 0.50\%. Other Negative Recoveries are estimated to be 0.25\% with Sales and Marketing Costs of 3.00\%. Taxes are assumed to be 20\%. 

Based on these assumptions it is projected that Total Revenue for 5 Years (mm US$) will be 13,834,026 with a maximum revenue of 6,500,492 in 5 years (mm US$). Total NIAT for 5 years (mm US$) will be 2,069,283 with a maximum NIAT of 1,129 810 in 5 years (mm US$). The Minimum Investment required for the project is 148 353 USD.  The Net Present Value @ 10 \% is $2 543 467 76 USD while the Internal Rate of Return is 186 \%. 

These assumptions provide a good indication of what can reasonably expected from the Alpha Project over the next five years if all conditions remain stable or improve as anticipated by management. It should also provide investors with an understanding of what their return on investment could look like if they choose to invest in this project as well as how much capital they need to commit upfront in order to make a profit from this venture. 

In summary this section provides an overview of the assumptions made by Alpha Project management regarding growth rates; inflation rates; packing/shipping costs; material costs; maintenance costs; other negative recoveries; sales/marketing costs; taxes; total revenue projections for five years; maximum revenue projections for five years; total NIAT projections for five years; maximum NIAT projections for five years and minimum investment required for the project along with NPV@10 \% and IRR calculations which give potential investors an idea of their expected returns on investment if they decide to invest in this venture.
