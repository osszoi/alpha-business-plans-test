 

Venezuelan Hot Dogs is a business founded by Lucas four years ago that sells gourmet hot dogs. Our target market is the people living in the Doral and our competitive advantage lies in quality and service. We offer a variety of hot dogs with different toppings, such as chili, bacon, cheese, onions and more. All of our products are made with fresh ingredients and we strive to provide an excellent customer experience by providing fast service and friendly staff. Our menu also includes side dishes such as french fries, onion rings and coleslaw. Additionally, we offer delivery services for customers who can't make it to our store location. 

We take pride in offering delicious food at an affordable price while maintaining high standards of quality control and customer satisfaction. We believe that our products will stand out from other competitors because they are made with only the freshest ingredients available in the market. Furthermore, we have implemented strict hygiene protocols to ensure that all of our food is safe for consumption. In addition to this, we also have an online ordering system which allows customers to conveniently place orders from their homes or offices without having to wait in line or worry about traffic or parking issues. Finally, we have invested heavily into digital marketing campaigns which target potential customers within the Doral area who may be interested in trying out Venezuelan Hot Dogs' unique offerings.
