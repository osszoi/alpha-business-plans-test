 

In conclusion, Alpha Project has made a number of assumptions in their projections for the next 5 years which are largely conservative and provide them with a competitive edge over their competitors. Inflation is assumed to remain constant while the growth rate is set high enough to take advantage of any potential opportunities that may arise during this period. Packing and shipping costs have been kept low due to sourcing from local vendors while material costs have also been kept low through similar means. Maintenance costs have been set relatively low given that much of Alpha Projects operations are conducted online while sales & marketing expenses have also been set relatively low compared to industry averages. Finally taxes remain constant throughout this period allowing them some predictability when it comes down budgeting accurately for tax payments each year.
