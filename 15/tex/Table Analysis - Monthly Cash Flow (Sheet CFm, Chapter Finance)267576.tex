\nonumsidenote{This section provides an analysis of the monthly cash flow for Alpha Project. It looks at the net income, depreciation and amortization, working capital, operating cash flow, capital expenditure from bank payment/loan, net cash, and cash balance over a twelve month period.}

The table in this section shows the monthly cash flow for Alpha Project over a twelve month period. The data shows that net income remains constant at 734 million US dollars each month. Depreciation and amortization (D&A) is also consistent across all months at 667 million US dollars each month. Working capital (WC) is 246 million US dollars in negative in the first month but is zero for all subsequent months. Operating Cash Flow (OCF) is 1,647 million US dollars in the first month but decreases to 1,401 million US dollars every other month due to WC being zero thereafter. Capital expenditure from bank payment/loan remains zero throughout this period while capital expenditure from share issue is 150000 million US dollars only during the first month of this period. Net cash and CF from investment remain unchanged during all months except for the first one where CF from investment was 150000 million US dollar and net cash was -148353 million US dollar respectively. Finally, Cash Balance increases by 402-403 millions each successive months starting with 1647 millions in the initial one until it reaches 17061 millions by end of this 12-month period as shown in Figure \ref{fig:cash_flow}.
