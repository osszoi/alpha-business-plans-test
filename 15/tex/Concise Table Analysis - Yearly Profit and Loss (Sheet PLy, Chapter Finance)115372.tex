Based on the financial table data provided, the company has seen a steady increase in revenue and profits over the five month period. Expenses have also increased, but at a slower rate than revenues. The Gross Profit Margin, EBITDA Margin, and EBIT Margin are all trending downwards indicating that expenses are increasing faster than revenues.
