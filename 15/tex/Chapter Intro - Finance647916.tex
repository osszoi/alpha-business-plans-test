 

This chapter provides an analysis of the assumptions made about growth rate, inflation, packing and shipping costs, material costs, maintenance costs, other negative recoveries, sales and marketing expenses and taxes for the Alpha Project. The results show that total revenue over five years is estimated to be 13.8 million US dollars with a maximum revenue of 6.5 million US dollars in five years. Total NIAT over five years is 2.1 million US dollars with a maximum NIAT in five years being 1.1 million US dollars. The minimum investment required for this project is 148353 US dollars while NPV@10 % for this project is 2543 467 76 dollars and IRR for this project is 186%. 

Based on these assumptions it can be concluded that the Alpha Project could be a viable business opportunity as it meets all the financial requirements needed to make it successful such as having an acceptable NPV@10 %, IRR greater than 100%, positive cash flow each year and low investment requirement. It should also be noted that even though there may be fluctuations in some of these variables during the period of investment due to external factors such as economic conditions or changes in government policies; however if correct strategies are implemented then Alpha Project can still succeed despite such external factors.
