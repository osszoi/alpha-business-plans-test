The company has seen significant growth in the past 5 years. Revenue has increased from $8,814 in year 1 to $1,129,810 in year 5. Operating expenses have also grown significantly over this period of time, with D&A and WC increasing from $8000 and -$39155 respectively in year 1 to $8000 and -$28042 respectively in year 5. This is a positive sign for the company's financial health as it indicates that the company is investing more resources into its operations which is resulting in higher profits. The operating cash flow has also increased significantly from $55,969 in year 1 to $1,165,852 in year 5. Furthermore, CAPEX investments have decreased over the past five years with no bank payments or loans taken out during this time period. 

Overall, the company appears to be doing well financially as evidenced by its rising revenue and profits over the past five years coupled with lower expenses and no debt. However, there are still areas of concern that should be addressed such as reducing WC costs further and increasing CAPEX investments to ensure future growth and sustainability of the business.
