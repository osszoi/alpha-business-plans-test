Venezuelan Hot Dogs is a Limited Liability Company (LLC) founded by Lucas four years ago. The company offers two hot dogs, hot dog 1 and hot dog 2, to the people living in the Doral. It has 5 employees and it has been able to sell 4MM in its current market. Venezuelan Hot Dogs' competitive advantage is quality and service, and its short-term and long-term business goals are selling 4MM and having 5 branches respectively. 

The size of Venezuelan Hot Dog's market is estimated at $30 billion dollars annually with high demand for their products or services due to all malls being full most days. There are many competitors within this industry such as great chains like McDonalds or Wendies but Venezuelan Hot Dog's main competitors are all the food restaurants in the Sawgrass Mall area due to its location there. Competitive pressures include price competition, product differentiation, and marketing strategies from other companies within this industry while suppliers have high bargaining power since there’s just one bread supplier available for them which makes them slightly vulnerable . Buyers do not have any bargaining power since prices cannot be negotiated lower than what they’re already set at while new entrants into this market can pose a potential threat due to their ability to offer better deals than existing ones already present on the market along with substitutes such as healthy options that could potentially take away customers from Venezuelan Hot Dog's target market if they become more popular than their products or services .

Venezuelan Hot Dogs offer two types of hot dogs: hot dog 1 and hot dog 2 which meet customer needs through taste, fast convenience while also offering local adaptations specific to Venezuela that appeal more towards their target audience within the local community living around them such as Venezuelans living in Doral area nearby Miami .
