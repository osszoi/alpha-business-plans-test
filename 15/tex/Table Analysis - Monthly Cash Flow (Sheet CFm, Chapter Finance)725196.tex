\nonumsidenote{This section provides an analysis of the monthly cash flow of Alpha Project. The table data includes net income, depreciation and amortization (D&A), working capital (WC) changes, operating cash flow, capital expenditure from bank and shareholders, cash flow from bank payments/loans, net cash, and cash balance.} 

The table data provided for Alpha Project shows that the company has a positive net income of 734 US$ in every month. This is followed by D&A expenses of 667 US$, which is slightly lower than the net income. The WC changes are negative 246 US$ each month. However, this does not affect the total amount as it is zeroed out in the Operating Cash Flow column. The Capital Expenditure from Bank and Shareholders is 0 US$ for all months except for the first one when it is 150 000 US$. This amount is then offset with a CF from Investment which adds 150 000 to the Net Cash column. 

The overall picture shows that Alpha Project has a relatively stable monthly cash flow throughout its operations. The Net Cash column indicates that there was a deficit of 148 353 US$ at the beginning of operations but this was recovered quickly due to investments made at month 1 (150 000). After this initial investment, all other months show positive values ranging between 1 401-17 060 US$. This means that Alpha Project can use these funds to finance its operations without having to resort to external financing or loans. 

In conclusion, Alpha Project has a healthy financial situation with steady monthly inflows which should be sufficient enough to finance its operational activities without needing additional funding sources such as loans or investments from external parties. In order to maintain this situation in future months and years, it would be prudent for management to closely monitor their spending habits and ensure they remain within their budget limits while also making sure not to miss any upcoming payments such as taxes or employee salaries/benefits etc..
