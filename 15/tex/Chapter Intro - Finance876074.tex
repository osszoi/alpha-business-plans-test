 

Alpha Project's financial performance has been improving consistently over time. In the five years since its inception, net income has increased significantly while operating cash flow and net cash position have also grown steadily. Capital expenditures were mainly funded through debt financing in years 1 and 2, but shifted to equity financing in years 3, 4 and 5. This shift to equity financing allowed Alpha Project to maintain a positive net cash position each year without needing additional external funding sources such as loans or credit lines. As a result, the overall cash balance of Alpha Project increased steadily throughout these five years reaching a peak of $2 198 403 at the end of Year 5 indicating that Alpha Projects financial health has been improving over time despite some hiccups along the way such as inconsistent working capital management practices.
