The purpose of Venezuelan Hot Dogs is to sell gourmet hot dogs with two different flavors: Hot Dog 1 and Hot Dog 2. The company's target market is people living in the Doral area who are looking for quality services and products.

The current trends in the food industry indicate that people are increasingly looking for healthy options when it comes to fast food options such as hotdogs; this presents both a challenge as well as an opportunity for Venezuelan Hot Dogs since they have to ensure that their product meets customer expectations while also maintaining their competitive edge over other similar businesses operating within the same space. In terms of bargaining power, suppliers have high bargaining power due to limited availability while buyers have no bargaining power whatsoever due to lack of alternatives available within the market space; this further increases competition among businesses vying for customers’ attention which makes it difficult for new entrants into the market space but also provides opportunities for existing businesses like Venezuelan Hot Dogs who can leverage their existing customer base through marketing campaigns targeting them specifically (e.g., word-of-mouth). 

Venezuelan Hot Dogs offer two distinct flavors: hot dog 1 and hot dog 2 which meet customer needs by providing great taste, convenience, speediness and local adaptation with a unique Venezuelan recipe being used within each flavor profile; this sets them apart from competitors who may not be able to provide such unique experiences with their products/services or may not be able to provide them at all due to pricing constraints or lack of resources/knowledge about local communities’ preferences when it comes to food items like hotdogs etc..
