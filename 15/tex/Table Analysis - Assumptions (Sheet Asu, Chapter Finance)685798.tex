\nonumsidenote{Summary: This section discusses the assumptions used to analyze the financials of Alpha Project, including growth, inflation, packing and shipping costs, material costs, maintenance costs, taxes incurred, and sales and marketing expenses. The results of the analysis are summarized in terms of total revenue over five years (mm US$), maximum revenue over five years (mm US$), total NIAT over five years (mm US$), maximum NIAT over five years (mm US$), minimum investment amount required for Alpha Project to be successful, NPV@10%, and IRR.}

The table data provided for Alpha Project includes several key assumptions that were used when analyzing its financials. These assumptions include growth rate of 80\%, inflation rate of 3\%, packing and shipping cost of 1.00\%, material cost of 1.00\%, maintenance cost of 0.50\%, other negative recoveries at 0.25\%, sales and marketing expenses at 3.00 \% , taxes incurred at 20 \%. 

Using these assumptions as a basis for analysis allowed us to calculate the total revenue over 5 years (in mm US$) which was 13 834 026; the maximum revenue in 5 years was 6 500 492; total NIAT in 5 years was 2 069 283; maximum NIAT in 5 years was 1 129 810; minimum investment amount needed for success was 148 353; NPV@10% came out to $2 543 467 76 ;and finally IRR came out to 186 \%. 

These results demonstrate that if all assumptions hold true then Alpha Project is likely to be successful with an estimated return on investment higher than most other projects currently available on the market today. Additionally it can be seen that even though there are some risks associated with investing into this project such as inflation or changes in market conditions they appear to have been accounted for within these calculations meaning that investors should feel comfortable investing into this project knowing their return will more than cover any potential losses due to unforeseen circumstances or events outside their control. 

In conclusion it appears that based on these calculations Alpha Project is likely a safe bet for investors who want a good return on their investments while still taking on some risk due to potential changes in market conditions or unforeseen circumstances outside their control. As long as all assumptions remain true then investors should feel comfortable investing into this project knowing they will get a good return on their money while also being able to sleep well at night knowing they have taken appropriate steps towards protecting themselves financially against any potential losses due unexpected external events or factors outside their control
