Summary: The Alpha Project business plan has made several assumptions that are key to its success, such as a growth rate of 80\%, inflation rate of 3\%, cost percentages associated with packing/shipping/materials/maintenance/sales&marketing/taxes; results summary regarding total & max revenue & NIAT over 5 years; minimum investment required; and measures such as NPV@10% and IRR used to evaluate potential return on investment compared against other investments available today. These assumptions provide useful information when making decisions about whether or not to invest in this project.
