Alpha Project is a business that has seen steady growth in its first 6 months of operation. Their revenues have increased from \$601200 to \$6500492, driven mainly by product sales. Cost of goods sold has also risen over this period due to increases in labor costs and material costs, but Alpha Project was able to maintain their pricing structure despite these rising input prices. As a result, gross profits rose significantly during the 6-month period from \$364200 at month 0 to $\3700303 by month 5. Operating expenses also increased but not as dramatically as gross profits which suggests that Alpha Projects was able to reduce overhead or increase efficiency during this time frame. The EBITDA margin for Alpha Project ranged between 3\%-22\% and their net income margin ranged between 1\%-17\%. This indicates healthy profitability for Alpha Projects given their current market position and size relative to competitors in their sector. Going forward it appears that if they are able to maintain operational efficiencies throughout all departments while continuing aggressive marketing strategies then they should see further increases in profitability over time.
