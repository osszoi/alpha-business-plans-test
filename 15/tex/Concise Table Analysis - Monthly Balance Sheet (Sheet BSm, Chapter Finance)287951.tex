The company's total assets have been steadily increasing over the 12-month period. However, the majority of these assets consist of fixed assets rather than current assets such as cash and accounts receivable. The company has very little accounts receivable and no long-term debt. While earnings have also increased over the period, they are relatively low compared to the total equity of the company. The company should focus on increasing their current assets and reducing expenses in order to improve profitability and increase shareholder value.
