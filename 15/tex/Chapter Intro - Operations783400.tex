Venezuelan Hot Dogs is a Limited Liability Company that has been operating for the past four years, offering gourmet hot dogs to the Venezuelan community living in Doral, Florida. The business employs five people and has one small store located in Sawgrass Mall. Venezuelan Hot Dogs has a competitive advantage of quality and service. Its short-term goal is to sell four million dollars worth of hot dogs, while its long-term plan is to expand to five branches throughout Miami. 

The operational processes include sourcing three suppliers for sausages, one supplier for bread, and purchasing sauces and other ingredients from Costco. Inventory management takes place on a weekly basis according to sales data from previous weeks. The company targets Venezuelans through social media campaigns, digital advertising campaigns, word-of-mouth referrals, and fliers distributed at malls within the target market radius. The pricing strategy focuses on offering high prices relative to other fast food restaurants yet still providing value for customers through unique recipes that cater specifically towards Venezuelans’ tastes as well as great packaging options that make it easier for customers who want something quick but don’t want it messy (i.e., no need for extra utensils etc.). Product distribution takes place at their store location within the Sawgrass Mall or online via delivery services like Uber Eats or Grubhub if customers prefer not leaving their homes or offices for lunch/dinner breaks etc.. 

In terms of human resources management Venezuelan Hot Dogs currently employ 10 people across full-time/part-time positions with plans of expanding this number further by hiring friends & family members who already live within Venezuela’s community here in Miami so they can help better understand what kind of flavors & preferences locals are looking for when it comes down to hot dog recipes etc.. Additionally basic HR policies such as those related with benefits/time off/performance evaluations comply with standard regulations set forth by law here in Florida – i.e., hourly employees etc.. Lastly employee training & development plans are also implemented so personnel can learn how best run operations according to company standards & expectations (i.e., customer service protocols/product knowledge/etc.).
