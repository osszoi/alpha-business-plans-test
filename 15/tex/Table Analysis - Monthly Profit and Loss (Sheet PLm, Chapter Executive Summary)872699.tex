Material cost stands at 500 per month while maintenance cost is also set at 500 monthly; other expenses total 125 monthly while IT cost stands at 300 monthly and sales & marketing 1500 monthly with a lease fee of 670 every single months indicating efficient management practices by the company's executives when it comes to controlling overhead spending without sacrificing quality or customer service levels.. 

The Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) margin stands at 3.16\% indicating moderate profitability before taking into account depreciation & amortization charges or interest payments on loans taken out by the company which have yet to be made due during this period.. The EBIT margin stands slightly lower than EBITDA but still remains healthy overall given its 1.83\% figure suggesting that Alpha Project has been able to make good use of its resources when it comes generating profits before taxes are taken into consideration.. Finally net income margin shows an impressive 1.47\% figure which means that after all deductions have been made such as current tax payments there's still some money left over for shareholders dividends or reinvestment back into business operations if desired.. 

Overall it appears that Alpha Project has managed its finances very efficiently during this period resulting in consistent revenues combined with moderate profitability margins allowing them remain competitive within their industry whilst providing customers with quality products & services
