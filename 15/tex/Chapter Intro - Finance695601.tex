 

In summary, Alpha Project has experienced a steady growth in its total assets, cash and inventories over the years. Current liabilities have increased significantly but remain relatively stable at certain points throughout its trajectory. Trade payables and other payables have also seen steady increases while long term debt remains constant across all five periods. Total equity and earnings have both seen steady increases throughout their trajectories as well.
