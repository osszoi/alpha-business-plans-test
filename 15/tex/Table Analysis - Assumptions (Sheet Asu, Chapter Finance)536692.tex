\nonumsidenote{This section will analyze the assumptions and data provided in order to create a business plan for the Alpha Project.}
The table provided contains assumptions and results from an analysis of the Alpha Project. Growth is assumed to be 80\%, inflation 3\%, packing and shipping 1.00\%, material cost 1.00\%, maintenance cost 0.50\%, others (neg. recoveries) 0.25\%, sales and marketing 3.00\% and taxes 20%. From this analysis, it was found that total revenue over 5 years would be 13,834,026 US dollars with a maximum revenue of 6,500,492 US dollars over that same period of time. Total NIAT (net income after tax) was determined to be 2,069,283 US dollars with a maximum NIAT of 1,129,810 US dollars over 5 years as well. The minimum investment required was calculated to be 148353 US dollars with a NPV@10% of $2,543,467.76 and an IRR of 186%. 

Using these assumptions and results obtained from the analysis allows us to create a comprehensive business plan for the Alpha Project which will help investors understand what they are investing in before making any decisions or commitments towards the project itself. Firstly by looking at growth rate it can be seen that there is potential for significant returns over time given that growth rate is being predicted at 80%. This should provide investors with some security knowing that their investments could potentially yield high returns if all goes according to plan for the Alpha Project. Inflation should also not pose too much of an issue since it is only being projected at 3%. 

Next we look at other costs associated with running such a project such as packing and shipping costs which are expected to amount to 1% of total revenue generated through sales as well as material costs which are also expected to amount up to 1% of total revenue generated through sales respectively; both figures seem reasonable given current market prices on similar materials used in production processes elsewhere around world today so this should not pose too much concern when considering investing into this project either directly or indirectly through stocks etc.. Maintenance costs were estimated at 0.50% per annum however there may still need further investigation into how exactly these maintenance costs will be covered as well as what kind of maintenance needs performing on different components associated with this project in order for it run efficiently without any major issues arising down line due unforeseen circumstances etc..  Lastly taxes have been estimated at 20%; again another reasonable figure given current standard tax rates imposed on businesses around world today so investors should feel comfortable knowing they wonâ€™t incur any unexpected charges when investing into this project either directly or indirectly via stock markets etc...  

Finally we look at results summary where total revenue generated over 5 years has been estimated 13 834 026 US dollars whilst
