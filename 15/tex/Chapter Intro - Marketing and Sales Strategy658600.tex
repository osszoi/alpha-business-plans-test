 

Venezuelan Hot Dogs is a business established by Lucas, located in Calle la colina edificio 32 Av Fuerzas Armadas Caracas. It offers two types of gourmet hot dogs – Hot Dog 1 and Hot Dog 2 – to the people living in the Doral. Venezuelan Hot Dogs has been operating for four years and has five employees. The main competitors are all the food restaurants in the Sograss Mall, with an estimated market size of 30 billion dollars. In order to capitalize on its strengths and opportunities whilst addressing weaknesses and threats posed by external factors, Venezuelan Hot Dogs plans to implement various strategies such as focusing their marketing campaigns around targeting Venezuelans living within the Doral area via social media platforms like Instagram or Twitter along with digital campaigns alongside word-of-mouth advertising techniques like fliers distributed at local malls etc., setting their pricing strategy higher than similar fast food outlets but still competitively priced enough to attract customers’ attention; distributing their products at their own sales point located inside Sawgrass Mall; differentiating themselves through packaging convenience specific to Venezuelans living abroad; hiring friends/family members within Venezuela who understand this culture better than anyone else; expanding physically by opening 6 stores over next year followed up annually with 6 more stores each year thereafter; managing inventory efficiently by analyzing sales data weekly before purchasing supplies accordingly; setting up HR policies based upon law regulations regarding hourly wages etc. These strategies will help Venezuelan Hot Dogs increase brand recognition, reach out to new markets, differentiate itself from competitors and ensure continued success in the long run.
