Assumptions where m = month and y = year

The assumptions presented in the table provide a solid foundation for the business plan chapter for Alpha Project. The first assumption is that the company will experience an average growth rate of 80%, which is quite high but not unrealistic given that it is a startup company with innovative products or services to offer to its customers.

Another important assumption is that inflation will be at 3%. This means that prices will increase by this percentage every year over the next five years. It is important to consider this when projecting future revenues and profits as it can have a significant impact on these figures.

Packing and shipping costs are estimated at 1%, which seems reasonable considering that Alpha Project may need to ship its products to different locations across the country or even internationally.

Material cost estimates are also at 1%, indicating that Alpha Project has carefully considered its production process to ensure efficient use of materials while keeping costs low.

Maintenance cost estimates are at 0.5%, which suggests that Alpha Project has taken into account any repairs or maintenance work needed for its equipment or facilities over time.

Others (neg. recoveries) are estimated at only 0.25%, indicating minimal losses due to unforeseen circumstances such as theft or damage during transportation.

Sales and marketing expenses are projected at 3%, suggesting significant investment in promoting and advertising Alpha Project's products or services to attract customers.

Finally, taxes are estimated at 20%, which is an important consideration for any business as it can significantly impact profits. Alpha Project must ensure that it complies with all tax regulations and laws to avoid any legal issues in the future.

The total NIAT (Net Income After Taxes) projected over five years is $2.1 million, with a maximum NIAT of $1.1 million. While these figures may seem low compared to the total revenue projections, they are still significant and indicate a profitable business model for Alpha Project.
