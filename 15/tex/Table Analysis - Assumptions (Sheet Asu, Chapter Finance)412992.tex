The Alpha Project is a business plan that has been developed over the past five years. The data in the table above provides an overview of the assumptions used for this project. 

Growth is expected to be 80\%, and inflation is estimated at 3\%. Packing and shipping costs are 1.00\%, material cost is 1.00\%, maintenance cost is 0.50\% and other negative recoveries are 0.25\%. Sales and marketing expenses are estimated at 3.00\% while taxes remain constant at 20\%. 

Based on these assumptions, total revenue over five years will be 13,834,026 US$ with a maximum revenue of 6,500,492 US$. Total NIAT (Net Income After Taxes) over five years will be 2,069,283 US$ with a maximum NIAT of 1,129,810 US$. The minimum investment required for this project is 148353 US$. Finally, NPV@10 \% (Net Present Value) was calculated to be $2,543 467.76 US$ with an IRR (Internal Rate of Return) of 186 \%. 

These assumptions provide a strong foundation for the Alpha Project's success as they demonstrate potential profitability and sustainability when implemented correctly. With proper planning and execution of these assumptions into actionable strategies within the business plan itself can help ensure that this project can reach its full potential in terms of growth and profitability over time. 

Summary: This section provides an overview of the assumptions used in developing the Alpha Project's business plan which includes estimates for growth rate (80%), inflation rate (3%), packing/shipping costs (1%), material cost (1%), maintenance cost(0.5%) , other negative recoveries(0.25%), sales/marketing expenses(3%) & taxes(20%). Based on these assumptions total revenue & NIAT were calculated to be 13M & 2M respectively with minimum investment being 148K & NPV@10 being $2M with IRR being 186%. These estimates provide a strong foundation for success if properly planned & executed through strategies within the business plan itself
