\nonumsidenote{This section provides an overview of the financial performance of Alpha Project from year 0 to year 5. It includes an analysis of the total assets, current assets, cash, accounts receivable (A/R), inventories, fixed assets, liabilities, current liabilities and trade payables. Additionally it looks at long term debt and equity shareholders earnings.}

At Alpha Project the total assets in year 0 are 207,708 which increased to 319,071 in year 1. This growth continued until reaching 654,969 in year 2 before increasing significantly to 1.36 million in year 3 and 2.57 million in year 4. The increase can be attributed to a combination of fixed asset acquisitions as well as increases in current asset levels such as cash and A/R balances. 

The cash balance at Alpha Project increased steadily over the 5 years from 55,969 to 345491 in year 2 before taking a large jump up to 1 million plus by end of Year 3 due largely to improved liquidity management practices implemented by senior management during that period. Accounts receivable also increased over this time but were relatively stable with no significant changes being seen between years 0-4 . Inventories however saw more significant changes with a steady increase observed from 9k up through 18k by end of Year 1 followed by a sharp drop back down below 10k before increasing again towards 15k by end of Year 4. 

Fixed Assets have been acquired steadily over this period starting at 142k for Year 0 then increasing incrementally each subsequent period until reaching 284k for Year 2 before dropping back down slightly for Years 3 & 4 respectively . Liabilities have remained relatively consistent throughout this period but have seen a general decrease overall after peaking at 91K during Year 1 . Current liability levels stayed relatively low throughout this period never exceeding 100K while Trade Payables remained constant at 379 between all periods tracked . Other payables decreased slightly from 88K during Year 1 down through 70K for Years 3 & 4 respectively while Provisions decreased significantly from 2665 during Year 1 through 511 during Year 4 due primarily to better risk management practices being implemented across the organization .  

 Long Term Debt was not applicable for Alpha Project so there is no data available on that front while Equity Shareholders Earnings increased significantly over this period starting out at 8K then jumping up nearly 50 fold by end of Period 5 when it reached 306K thanks largely to improved operational efficiency measures put into place early on combined with successful new product launches later on which helped drive top line revenue growth across all segments . Finally Total Equity increased substantially over this time frame going from 158K up through 227 K then nearly tripling itself once again by end of Period 5 when it hit 487 K thanks largely to sustained profitability achieved since inception combined with prudent capital allocation decisions made along the way . 

 In summary Alpha Projects financial performance has
