Based on the data provided in the table, it appears that the company is doing well financially. The Net Income and D&A are both positive, indicating that the company is generating revenue and has a healthy operating cash flow. The WC figure is zero, meaning there are no expenses associated with working capital. Capital Expenditure from both banks and shareholders is also zero, indicating that there is no need for additional funding or investments at this time. Furthermore, the Cash Balance figure shows a steady increase over time which suggests that the company's overall financial health is good. 

However, there are some areas of concern that should be addressed by the company. For example, it appears that there was a large investment of $150,000 in month 1 but this amount does not appear to have been recouped in any subsequent months. Additionally, while CF from Bank Payment/Loan figures remain at zero throughout all months shown in the table it could indicate potential issues with repayment of debt or other liabilities. 

Overall, based on the data presented here it appears as though the company's financial health is good but further investigation into areas such as investments and repayment of debts should be conducted to ensure future success and sustainability.
