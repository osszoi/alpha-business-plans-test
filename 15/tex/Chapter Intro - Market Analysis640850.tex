Trends within the industry include people eating healthier food and fast food options becoming more common. Challenges facing this industry include high competition, low prices, supply chain issues, price competition from product differentiation or marketing strategies employed by competitors and high bargaining power from suppliers due to limited sources available for certain supplies such as breads used for hot dogs buns; buyers do not have any bargaining power over prices due to lack thereof in fast food industries but there is always a threat of new entrants into this field which can lead to increased competition among existing players on both price points as well as product offerings or services provided by new entrants into this industry space that might be more attractive than what existing companies offer currently . Additionally there may also be threat of substitutes arising from healthier options being made available that could potentially take away customers from traditional fast food outlets like those offering gourmet hot dog products such as those offered by Venezuelan Hot Dogs .
