Venezuelan Hot Dogs is a business focused on selling gourmet hot dogs to the people living in the Doral area. Our competitive advantage lies in our quality and services, which are superior to those of other fast food restaurants. To capitalize on this advantage and reach our target market, we have developed a comprehensive marketing and sales strategy that includes setting a high price for our products, targeting the Venezuelan community through digital campaigns, word-of-mouth marketing, fliers in malls, and direct sales; distributing through a small store located in Sawgrass Mall; and employing 10 full-time employees with benefits such as hourly pay, vacation time off, performance evaluations etc. We also plan to open 6 more stores within the next year with an additional 6 stores per year after that throughout Miami area. Through these strategies we hope to reach our short-term goal of selling 4 million dollars worth of product and long-term goal of having 5 branches within 5 years.
