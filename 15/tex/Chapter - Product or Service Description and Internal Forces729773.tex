The internal strengths of Venezuelan Hot Dogs include its unique recipe as well as a strong brand built over four years of operations. Its weaknesses include limited resources due to lack of capital investment. External opportunities available to the business include new markets such as the large Venezuelan population in the area who are looking for innovative tastes as well as partnerships with other businesses or technological advancements that could help improve efficiency. External threats facing the business include competition from larger chains such as McDonald's or Wendy's which offer lower prices than Venezuelan Hot Dogs; suppliers who have a high bargaining power; buyers who have no bargaining power; new entrants entering into the market every day; substitutes such as healthy options; economic recession affecting demand for products; regulatory changes that may affect how business is conducted; economic downturns reducing consumer spending power.
