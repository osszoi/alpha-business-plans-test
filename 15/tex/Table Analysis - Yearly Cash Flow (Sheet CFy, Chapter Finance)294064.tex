\nonumsidenote{This section provides an analysis of the yearly cash flow of Alpha Project. It covers net income, operating cash flow, and cash balance for each year from 1 to 5. The data suggests that Alpha Project's cash balance is increasing over time.}

The table below shows the yearly cash flow of Alpha Project from year 1 to 5. Net income (column 2) increased from 8,814 in year 1 to 1,129,810 in year 5. Depreciation and amortization (D&A) expenses (column 3) remained constant at 8,000 throughout all five years. Wages and salaries (column 4) decreased from 39,155 in year 1 to 28,042 in year 5. Operating cash flow (column 5) increased substantially over the period - rising from 55,969 in year 1 to 1,165,852 in year 5. Capital expenditure funded by bank payments or loans (CAPEX-fbank) was 0 for all five years while capital expenditure funded by shares issued by Alpha Project (CAPEX-fshare) was 150k for years one and two but then fell to 0 for the remaining three years. 

Net Cash (column 8), which is calculated as operating cash flow minus CAPEX-fbank and CAPEX-fshare combined with bank payment/loan received or paid out respectively during each period was negative (-94k) for year one but improved significantly over time until it reached 687k in positive territory by end of Year 4 before dropping back down slightly (-63k) at end of Year 5 due mainly to higher capital expenditures funded by share issue during Years One and Two when compared with Years Three through Five where there were no such expenditures made via share issues. 

Finally we have Cash Balance which is calculated as Net Cash plus any investments made during that period minus any withdrawals made during that period if applicable; this figure rose steadily throughout all five years - starting off at 56k at end of Year One before reaching a high point of 2198k at end of Year Five due mainly to increasing net incomes combined with decreasing wages & salaries expense as well as reduced CAPEX spending towards the latter part of the period covered herewith no new share issues being made after Year Two. 

Overall this data indicates that Alpha Project's financial position has been improving steadily over time due mainly to increasing net income combined with decreasing wages & salaries expense along with reduced CAPEX spending towards the latter part of this period covered herewith no new share issues being made after Year Two; thus suggesting a healthy financial outlook going forward into future periods provided these trends continue unabated going forward into future periods beyond those covered hereinabove within this report today henceforth now ad infinitum amen!
