Venezuelan Hot Dogs is a Limited Liability Company founded four years ago by Lucas. The company offers gourmet hot dogs, with two different recipes, to the people living in the Doral area. Venezuelan Hot Dogs has five employees and an annual revenue of 30 billion dollars. Its competitive advantage lies in its quality and services. The short-term and long-term business goals are to sell 4 million dollars’ worth of products and have 5 branches in the Miami area, respectively. The key members of the Venezuelan Hot Dogs management team are Lucas (President), Raul (Vice President) and Andres (Operations Manager). The company operates one small facility in Doral to prepare food and one small store in Sawgrass Mall for sales purposes with three suppliers for sausages, one supplier for breads, and other ingredients purchased from Costco on a weekly basis based on sales analysis from previous weeks. 

Venezuelan Hot Dogs targets Venezuelan community living in Doral area as its primary market with high demand for their products due to growing trend of healthy fast food options among consumers. There is significant competition from great chains like McDonalds or Wendies but Venezuelan Hot Dog’s unique recipe sets it apart from them providing it an edge over them. Bargaining power of suppliers is high as there is only one bread supply while there is no bargaining power for buyers due to lack of substitutes available at same prices or lower prices than that offered by Venezuelan Hot Dogs. Moreover, threat of new entrants is also present every day but can be managed through marketing campaigns focusing on local community which will help differentiate product offerings from competitors’ products or services significantly along with internal strengths like strong brand name among locals etc.. Pricing strategy adopted by the company is relatively higher than other fast food restaurants which helps maximize profits per sale while distribution network consists only physical store located at Sawgrass Mall currently with plans to expand this network further in near future subject to availability of resources required for expansion purpose such as capital etc.. Human resource policies include benefits packages, time off policies and performance evaluation criteria based on law while hiring plans involve friends and family members belonging to local community who understand cultural needs better than outsiders thus helping promote brand name further within local population base more effectively without much effort required compared to hiring professionals externally etc.. Employee training plan exists which focuses on developing skillsets amongst existing workforce according to standards set internally by management team so that customer service levels remain consistent across all stores even after expansion plans materialize successfully over time period specified initially during planning phase itself..
