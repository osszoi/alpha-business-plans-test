This chapter provides an overview of the financial plan for Venezuelan Hot Dogs, a business that sells gourmet hot dogs targeting people living in the Doral area. The competitive advantage of Venezuelan Hot Dogs lies in its quality and services. The short-term and long-term goals are to sell 4 million hot dogs per year and have 5 branches. The company has been in operation for 4 years with 5 employees and is a limited liability company founded by Lucas, who is now the President, Raul is Vice President, and Andres serves as Operations Manager. 

The main competitors are all food restaurants in the Sawgrass Mall while the market size is 30 billion dollars with high demand due to full malls. Trends in this industry include people eating healthy food and fast food while challenges include high competition, low prices, and supply chain issues. Bargaining power of suppliers is high due to there being only one bread supplier while buyers have no bargaining power when it comes to pricing. Threats of new entrants into this industry are increasing every day while substitutes such as new healthy options present a threat as well. 

Venezuelan Hot Dogs offers two types of hot dogs: Hot Dog 1 and Hot Dog 2 which meet customer needs through taste, speediness, and convenience over competitors’ products or services offered in this space.
