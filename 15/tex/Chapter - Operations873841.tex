There is high competition, low prices and supply chain pressure within the industry which creates competitive pressure from price competition, product differentiation and marketing strategies from other businesses. The bargaining power of suppliers within the industry is high due to there being only one bread supplier while buyers have no bargaining power. There is also a threat of new entrants entering into the market every day as well as substitutes such as healthy options becoming increasingly popular.
