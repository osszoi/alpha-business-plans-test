The company has a unique recipe and provides quality service that sets it apart from its competitors. This chapter will provide an analysis of Venezuelan Hot Dogs' financials, including a description of their products or services, market analysis, marketing strategy, and yearly cash flow. 

The company's two types of hot dogs - “Hot Dog 1” and “Hot Dog 2” - have high demand due to their taste and convenience. Their market size is estimated at 30 billion dollars annually with current trends leaning towards healthier eating habits and increased competition among fast food restaurants like McDonalds or Wendy's. Suppliers have high bargaining power due to limited supply options while buyers have no bargaining power as prices are fixed by the restaurant chain itself. New entrants into the market are common but not significant enough to be considered a threat; however substitutes such as healthy alternatives do pose a threat. 

Venezuelan Hot Dogs' target market includes Venezuelans living in the Doral area where they plan on reaching them through advertising channels such as social media platforms or direct sales methods such as fliers distributed within malls located nearby their main branch located inside Sawgrass Mall itself . Pricing strategies will focus on setting prices higher than those typically associated with fast food restaurants , furthermore distribution will occur exclusively within their store located inside Sawgrass Mall . 

An analysis of Alpha Project's yearly cash flow data shows that despite a decrease in net income from year 1 to year 2, operating cash flow increased substantially due to a reduction in wages and salaries paid out by Alpha Project during this time frame. Capital expenditures decreased significantly in years 4 and 5 allowing for significant net cash inflows while investments generated additional cash inflows which allowed for a positive balance at the end of each year. Overall it can be seen that Alpha Project has managed its finances effectively resulting both large increases with respect to operating profits as well as significant reductions when it comes capital expenditure requirements thus allowing for greater levels net cash inflow than would have otherwise been possible without these reductions being made at all
