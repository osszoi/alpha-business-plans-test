\nonumsidenote{This section presents an analysis of the monthly profit and loss data for the Alpha Project. The results show that revenue and product sales remain constant each month, while cost of goods sold, operating expenses, labor costs, rent, material costs, maintenance costs, other expenses (negative recoveries), IT costs, sales and marketing costs and lease fees are all kept at a consistent level. Gross profit margin is 60.58\%, EBITDA margin is 3.16\%, EBIT margin is 1.83\% and net income margin is 1.47\%.} 

The Alpha Project’s monthly profit and loss data shows that revenue from product sales remains consistent each month at 50,100 units. Other services contribute no revenue to the project during this period with zero reported in every month across the year-long study period. This suggests that either no other services were provided or they were provided free of charge by the company over this period of time. 

Costs associated with producing these products are also relatively stable over this same period with Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) reported as 19750 units per month on average; Labor Costs at 22000 units per month; Rent at 2500 units per month; Material Costs at 500 units per month; Maintenance Costs also at 500 units per month; Other Expenses (Negative Recoveries) reported as 125 units per month on average; IT Costs reported as 300 units per months on average; Sales & Marketing Costs recorded as 1500 unit per months on average; Lease Fees recorded as 670 unit per months on average – all remaining constant throughout the twelve-month period under review here. 

These figures result in a Gross Profit Margin of 60.58 \%, which can be considered good performance when compared to industry averages in similar sectors - suggesting that Alpha Project has been able to keep its production costs low while still maintaining a healthy gross profit margin overall despite having relatively fixed prices for its products over this twelve-month period studied here.. Additionally Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation & Amortization (EBITDA) Margin stands at 3.16 \%, Earnings Before Interest & Taxation (EBIT) Margin stands at 1.83 \% whilst Net Income Margin stands at 1 .47 \%. All three figures suggest good performance from Alpha Project’s operations over this twelve-month period studied here – indicating that it has managed to maintain profitability despite having fixed prices for its products throughout this time frame studied here.. 

Overall then it appears that Alpha Project has performed well financially during this twelve-month study period – maintaining high levels of gross profits whilst keeping cost structures relatively low throughout – resulting in healthy margins across all key metrics measured here.. This suggests good financial management within the company over recent times which bodes well for future
