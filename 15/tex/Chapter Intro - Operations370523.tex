Venezuelan Hot Dogs is a business that specializes in the sale of Venezuelan-style hot dogs and other related food items. The company currently operates two physical facilities, one in Doral which serves as a kitchen to prepare their food items and another store located in the Sawgrass Mall which customers can visit directly or take advantage of catering services offered by Venezuelan Hot Dogs. The company has three suppliers for its sausages, one supplier for its breads, with all other ingredients coming from Costco; it also maintains an area dedicated solely to storing frozen food items so that freshness is maintained while reducing waste due to spoilage or expiration dates passing by without being used up. Purchases are made on a weekly basis based on sales data from that week so that there is always enough stock available without overstocking or understocking any particular item. Plans are also currently underway to expand operations into more locations throughout Miami-Dade County so as to reach out even further into potential customer bases while increasing overall revenue streams through additional locations. 

The current size and capacity of these facilities are sufficient for Venezuelan Hot Dogs' current operations, however they have plans to expand the number of locations in order to reach more customers and increase sales. Inventory management and supply chain management play important roles within the business, ensuring that products remain fresh while not overstocking or understocking any particular item. This helps maintain cost efficiency and ensures customer satisfaction with consistent product quality. In addition, careful consideration is given when selecting new locations for expansion, taking into account factors such as local demographics, competition level and access points for both customers and suppliers alike. 

Overall, Venezuelan Hot Dogs has established itself as a successful business within Miami-Dade County thanks to its focus on providing quality products at competitive prices along with excellent customer service provided by knowledgeable staff members who understand how important it is to keep their customers happy. With plans already underway for further expansion across the county, it looks set to continue growing as time goes on and provide even more delicious hot dogs throughout South Florida!
