Based on the financial table data provided, the company has seen a steady increase in revenue over the five months with a peak of 6.5 million US dollars in month 5. The gross profit margin is trending downward, however, and operating expenses have exceeded labor costs since month 3. Additionally, EBITDA and EBIT margins have been declining since month 2. Overall, the company's financial health appears to be strong with increasing revenue but areas of concern should be addressed such as decreasing margins and rising expenses to ensure continued success.
