 

This chapter outlines the Human Resources strategy for Venezuelan Hot Dogs. The company currently employs 10 people and plans to expand its workforce by hiring friends and family from the Venezuelan community. To stay competitive, they plan to focus on the needs of the local Venezuelan community and provide high quality products with great packaging, convenience, and faster service than other fast food restaurants. Furthermore, they will launch a marketing campaign targeting their local community while implementing a pricing strategy that is higher than competitors but still within reasonable limits. Finally, they will also maintain an efficient supply chain management system which includes monitoring inventory levels according to sales figures in order to ensure customers have access to fresh ingredients at all times while reducing costs associated with overstocking or understocking of supplies. All employees will be trained in customer service as well as operations training such as supply chain management and inventory control in order to ensure standards are maintained across all departments.
