The Alpha Project is a business plan with the objective of increasing revenue and net income after taxes (NIAT). To achieve this, assumptions have been made about growth, inflation, packing and shipping costs, material costs, maintenance costs, other negative recoveries, sales and marketing expenses and taxes. 

Growth has been assumed at 80\%. Inflation has been assumed at 3\%, while packing and shipping costs have been estimated at 1.00\%. Material cost has also been estimated at 1.00\%, along with maintenance cost being 0.50\% and other negative recoveries 0.25\%. Sales and marketing expenses are expected to be 3.00\% of total revenue while taxes are assumed to be 20\% of total revenue. 

Based on these assumptions the results summary show that total revenue over five years is estimated to be 13,834,026 US$ with maximum revenue in five years being 6,500,492 US$. Total NIAT over five years is 2,069,283 US$ with maximum NIAT in five years being 1,129,.810 US$. The minimum investment required for this project is 148353 US$. Finally the NPV@10 \% for this project is $2 543 467 76 dollars while IRR for this project is 186 \%. 

This analysis indicates that Alpha Project could be a viable business opportunity as it meets all the financial requirements needed to make it successful such as having an acceptable NPV@10 \%, IRR greater than 100 \%, positive cash flow each year and low investment requirement. It should also be noted that even though there may be fluctuations in some of these variables during the period of investment due to external factors such as economic conditions or changes in government policies; however if correct strategies are implemented then Alpha Project can still succeed despite such external factors. 

Summary: This chapter provides an analysis of assumptions made about growth rate , inflation ,packing & shipping cost ,material cost ,maintenance cost ,other negative recoveries ,sales & marketing expenses & taxes . Based on these assumptions it was found that Alpha Project would generate good returns on investments like NPV@10 \% & IRR greater than 100 \%; moreover it requires low initial investments . Thus overall Alpha Project appears to be a viable business opportunity provided appropriate strategies are implemented despite any external factors affecting its success .
