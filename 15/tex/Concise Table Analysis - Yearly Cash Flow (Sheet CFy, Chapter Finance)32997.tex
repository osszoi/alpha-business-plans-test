The company has shown steady growth in revenue, with net income increasing from 8,814 in year 1 to 1,129,810 in year 5. However, there is a concern regarding the negative working capital (WC) which has increased over the years. The operating cash flow has also increased significantly but is offset by high capital expenditures (CAPEX) on shares. Despite this, the company's cash balance has grown steadily due to positive cash flows from investments. The company should focus on improving its working capital management to ensure long-term sustainability and reduce reliance on external financing.
