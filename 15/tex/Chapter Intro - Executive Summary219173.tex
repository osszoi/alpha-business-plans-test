Physical facilities consist solely of one small store located inside Sawgrass Mall used primarily for preparing food items while operational processes involve three different suppliers providing sausages along with single supplier providing breads needed on daily basis alongside sauces & ingredients purchased directly from Costco stores . Inventory & supply chain management consists primarily out of weekly purchases made based off past week's sales numbers allowing company to maintain proper levels without facing shortages during peak hours .
