The company's revenues have been steadily increasing over the past five months, with a total of $6.5 million in the most recent month. However, expenses have also been increasing, particularly labor costs and sales and marketing expenses. The company has managed to maintain a gross profit margin of around 60%, but its net income margin is relatively low at around 1-2%. The EBITDA margin has improved significantly from 3% to over 21% in the most recent month. The company should focus on reducing expenses and improving profitability to ensure long-term financial health.
