In this chapter, we discussed the financial aspects of Venezuelan Hot Dogs. We outlined the current financial situation and future goals, as well as the pricing strategy, capital requirements, and potential sources of financing. We also made assumptions about growth rates, inflation rates, packing/shipping costs, material costs, maintenance costs, negative recoveries & sales/marketing expenses to calculate estimates of total revenues & net income after taxes (NIAT). These estimates suggest that sufficient funding & resources must be available in order to achieve stated projections & that adjustments may need to be made should market conditions change unexpectedly during the course of development. Finally we concluded that Venezuelan Hot Dogs has a strong foundation with clear goals that can be achieved through careful planning regarding pricing strategies and capital requirements while taking advantage of existing strengths within its target market.
