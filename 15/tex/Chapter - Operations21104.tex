Venezuelan Hot Dogs, owned by Lucas, is located at Calle la colina edificio 32 Av Fuerzas Armadas Caracas. Venezuelan Hot Dogs offers gourmet hot dogs such as hot dog 1 and hot dog 2 to the people living in the Doral area. Venezuelan Hot Dogs has a competitive advantage of quality and services that sets it apart from its competitors. The short-term goal for Venezuelan Hot Dogs is to sell 4MM and have 5 branches while the long-term goal is to become one of the top food vendors in Miami. 

Venezuelan Hot Dogs is a Limited Liability Company that has been in operation for 4 years with key members of management being Lucas (President), Raul (Vice President) and Andres (Operations Manager). Currently, there are 5 employees working at Venezuelan Hot Dogs with annual revenue yet to be determined. The business was founded when Lucas had a small point of hotdogs in New York City which proved successful enough to move operations to Miami where he saw potential growth opportunities. 

The main competitors for Venezuelan Hot Dogs are all the food restaurants located in Sograss Mall with a market size estimated at 30 billion dollars. Currently, there is high demand for products or services offered by Venezuelan Hot Dogs as all malls are full due to trends in healthy eating and fast food options. There are many sources of competitive pressure within this industry such as price competition, product differentiation and marketing strategies employed by major chains like McDonalds and Wendies. Suppliers have high bargaining power due to limited resources while buyers have no bargaining power since they must purchase from what’s available on the market. The threat of new entrants into this industry is constant as every day more businesses enter into the market offering similar products or services along with substitutes such as healthier options for consumers who want an alternative option than traditional fast food restaurants like Venezuelan Hot Dog's offerings . 

Venezuelan Hot Dog's products or services meet customer needs through taste, speediness and convenience while also providing local adaptation tailored towards Venezuela's local community culture through unique recipes not found elsewhere. Internal strengths include unique products or services offered along with strong brand recognition among customers however weaknesses include limited resources necessary for expansion alongside weak brand awareness outside Miami’s local community . External opportunities exist through entering new markets , forming partnerships and taking advantage of technological advancements while external threats include competition , regulatory changes , economic downturns amongst others . Strategies implemented should focus on capitalizing on internal strengths & opportunities whilst addressing weaknesses & threats through marketing & communication campaigns targeting Venezuela’s local community . 

 Target markets identified should be those within Venezuela’s local community residing within Doral area whilst reaching them through advertising , social media , direct sales etcetera . Pricing strategy employed should be higher than average prices seen within fast-food sector while distributing product or service via sales point located in Sawgrass Mall's food corner . Differentiation between competitors should be focused on providing great packaging alongside convenience served faster than other fast-food restaurants plus catering towards Venezuela’s local community culture unlike any other restaurant out there currently operating within Miami area .  

 Current workforce size stands at 10 employees consisting mostly part time staff however plans exist for hiring & workforce expansion via friends & family members belonging to Venezuela’s local community . HR policies implemented adhere mostly towards legal requirements related hourly employees whilst training plans exist geared towards employee development based upon company standards set forth by management team overseeing operations running smoothly throughout year round activities conducted daily basis without fail .
