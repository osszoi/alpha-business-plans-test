 

Venezuelan Hot Dogs is a gourmet hot dog business that has been in operation for four years. It offers two types of hot dogs: Hot Dog 1 and Hot Dog 2, with unique Venezuelan recipes, high quality ingredients, and fast delivery. The company currently has five employees and sells 4 million annually, with plans to open five branches. Its competitive advantage lies in its unique recipe, taste, convenience, local adaptation and great packaging. To capitalize on its strengths while addressing weaknesses and threats from external sources, the company can implement marketing campaigns targeted at Venezuelans living in Doral as well as differentiate itself by emphasizing their culture while providing great packaging options for customers seeking convenience when purchasing goods from them. Pricing strategy should be set at a premium level compared to other fast food restaurants while distribution will take place through sales points located within food corners at Sawgrass Mall itself. Human resources management policies should follow laws regarding hourly employees while also taking into account plans for hiring family members from within Venezuelaâ€™s community if possible when expanding workforce size . When it comes to operational processes manufacturing will involve three different suppliers for sausages along with one supplier for bread while sauces can be purchased directly from Costco . Inventory management should involve weekly purchases based on demand predictions made by sales staff or using data generated from previous sales numbers.
