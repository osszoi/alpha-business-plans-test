 

This chapter provides an analysis of the monthly cash flow data for Alpha Project. The cash flow from bank payment/loan is zero in all months, indicating that no loans were taken out during this period. Capital expenditure was only incurred at month 0 in the form of funds raised through equity issuance. Net income remained steady throughout all months due to depreciation and amortization being equal to net income each month. Operating cash flow increased steadily over time as WC decreased from month 0 to month 12. This analysis has shown that while there was some variation in working capital over time for Alpha Project's monthly cash flows, overall these figures remained relatively stable throughout all twelve months given that no additional loans or expenditures were taken out by the company during this period. The data provided also indicates that despite incurring significant initial costs associated with raising equity funds at Month 0 ($150 million), these costs are likely outweighed by what will be gained through higher operating profits over time as WC decreases going forward into 2021 and beyond.
