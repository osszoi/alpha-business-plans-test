The company's revenue has been consistently increasing over the past 5 months, with a total of $6.5 million in the latest month. However, expenses have also increased significantly, resulting in a net income of $1.1 million in the latest month. The gross profit margin has decreased from 60.58% to 56.92%, indicating potential issues with cost management. The EBITDA and EBIT margins are healthy at over 20%, but interest expenses are starting to accrue. The company should focus on controlling costs and managing debt to maintain profitability in the long term.
