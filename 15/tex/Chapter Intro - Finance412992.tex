 

This finance chapter of the Alpha Project's business plan outlines the assumptions used to estimate potential profitability and sustainability of the project. The growth rate is estimated at 80\%, with inflation rate at 3\%. Packing and shipping costs, material cost, maintenance cost, other negative recoveries, sales and marketing expenses are all estimated at 1.00\%, 0.50\%, 0.25\%, 3.00\% respectively while taxes remain constant at 20\%. Based on these estimates total revenue over five years is expected to be 13 million US dollars with a maximum revenue of 6 million US dollars, while total NIAT (Net Income After Taxes) over five years is estimated to be 2 million US dollars with a maximum NIAT of 1 million US dollars. The minimum investment required for this project is 148 thousand US dollars while NPV@10 \% (Net Present Value) was calculated to be $2M with an IRR (Internal Rate of Return) of 186 \%. These assumptions provide a strong foundation for the Alpha Project's success as they demonstrate potential profitability and sustainability when implemented correctly. With proper planning and execution of these assumptions into actionable strategies within the business plan itself can help ensure that this project can reach its full potential in terms of growth and profitability over time.
